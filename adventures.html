        <!-- Stories about a few of my adventures -->
        I have been on many adventures. Most notable ones would be my ski biking trip
        to Breckenridge Colorado where I rented a ski bike for 6 days and explored the
        ski mountain with my family. Flying through the woods on a bike that has skis for
        tires was incredible and I cannot wait to do it again. Another notable trip was
        when I explored Buttermilk falls in Vermont with a few friends. It was winter and
        most of the falls was frozen over, making the area look super neat and magical. A
        small section of the trip was captured on camera and can be viewed by visiting my
        youtube channel. Also a link to my youtube channel can be found below where other
        adventures have been documented.
