    <!-- Paragraph that briefly describes my interests -->
    <p>
        It all started when I was born, on April 26 1996. I was born in Hartford and have spent
        most of my life in Columbia, a small farm town in eastern Connecticut. Growing up I had a
        great interest in computers. I always wondered what exactly was going on inside the box, how
        the calculations were made, etc. I had so many unanswered question about them, which is what
        motivated me to continue to learn more and more about them. But computers was not my only
        interest, I also have been fascinated with cars. Specifically restoring older vehicles and making
        them look and function as if they are brand new. I have started a truck restoration project of my own, and more information
        about that can be found by clicking on "Truck Restoration" in the nav bar. I also love exploring
        places on my free time. Visit the "Adventures" page to learn more about where I have been.
