        <!-- Story of the truck and how I recieved it -->
        I inherited this 1994 Chevy S10 Blazer from my grandfather. When I recieved this truck,
        it only had 159k miles on it but it needed a lot of work to get it running again. To my
        surprise, the interior was in mint condition, the seats and floors looked brand new, like
        nobody had ever been inside before. However, the engine bay was a much different story. I
        discovered multiple mouse nests and many wires that had been chewed up, making for lots of
        little issues here and there. Slowly but surely, I got the truck running and now just have to
        continue the maintenance and fix a few things here and there to keep it going.
