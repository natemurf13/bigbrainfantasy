        <!-- Explaining why and how an xbox breaks -->
        The RROD, which is short for "Red Ring of Death" happens when the solder connections
        underneath the CPU or GPU crack and are no longer making good contact between the board
        and the chip. This is due to the fact that lead free solder is used on this board, because
        it is much cheaper. Normally this would be a fine substitute, but with the poor air flow
        design of the xbox 360, it can get hot enough to start to melt the solder a bit, and then
        the solder will re solidify, and over time this causes cracks, giving players the RROD.
    </p>

        <!-- Explaining the solution -->
        Luckily, there is a quick fix for this to get an extra few months or so out of your console.
        You will need a reflow station as the above picture shows, that will evenly heat up the bottom
        of the board, and a heat gun to heat the chips from above.
