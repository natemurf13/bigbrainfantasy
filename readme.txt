Jaketopia - CS601 Final Project

A biography about my life and my interests.

You can see I used Vue on the Organization page to create a dynamic
toto list. Where the user can add and remove tasks, the DOM is altered
when the Add Task button is pressed, showing a message that disappears.

Also Vue is used to populate the results of the survey into a table
format on the Wood tab.

My resume can be viewed from either the Resume tab, or by clicking the
view resume button on the home page.

I went above and beyond in this project by having many pages, and using
Javascript to make the experience more unique, such as adding custom pop
up windows and form validation.

This is my first time doing web development and I am super proud of this
website. I am so happy to finally have an understanding for the web
development community and I can say with confidence that I know HTML, CSS,
and Javascript.
