-- Homework #1

In order to run this website, just launch the index.html and use
the navigation within the site to take you to the other pages. Easy.

I went above and beyond by creating 2 extra pages, and having an extra
external link to my youtube as well as my github page. I also had a lot
of text explaining a guide on how to fix an xbox 360, with a step by step
instructions. You mentioned in the live session that iframes were fine to use
because flash is obsolete, so I used that and there was 1 error in the w3
schools validator, I hope this is fine.

I removed the iframe as per our conversation through email.

-- Homework #2

I have added tons of styling which has been applied to all of my pages to
show a consistent theme of the website. I have a separate print.css file
that is specifically for the look of the page when printing it. A few of the
differences here is that I removed all colors (except for images), and set
all font colors to black. I shrunk all images down as to not waste the user's
ink. Also the footer was enlarged to give clear credit to the developer. Also
on the code projects page, I removed the video from appearing on the screen when
printing because it doesnt add much value when printed.

I went above and beyond on this assignment by styling every element of my website,
and also having many differences between the css that displays my pages, and the css
that prints my pages. I also think I did a good job on the nav bar. Having it so the
boxes will highlight when you mouse hover over them. I also did this with the github
button external hyperlink.

Overall I am very happy with my project and I am looking forward to learning more
about css and doing some code refactors to make things even nicer.
